# Bike-Sales-Dashboard


## Overview

The goal is to streamline the dataset, providing a focused and concise representation that facilitates a clear understanding of key trends and patterns within European bike sales.

#### Dataset
This dataset, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadiqshah/bike-sales-in-europe/data, encapsulates information on bike sales in Europe. It includes diverse columns such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike. A comprehensive data-cleaning process was undertaken as part of the preliminary steps before developing an insightful overview using visualization tools like PowerBI. This involved handling missing values, transforming existing columns, and structuring the dataset for optimal analysis.
