# Bike-Sales-Dashboard


## Overview

The goal is to streamline the dataset, providing a focused and concise representation that facilitates a clear understanding of key trends and patterns within European bike sales.
This dataset, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadiqshah/bike-sales-in-europe/data, encapsulates information on bike sales in Europe. It includes diverse columns such as ID, Marital Status, Gender, Income, Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars, Commute Distance, Region, Age, and Purchased Bike. A comprehensive data-cleaning process was undertaken as part of the preliminary steps before developing an insightful overview using visualization tools like PowerBI. This involved handling missing values, transforming existing columns, and structuring the dataset for optimal analysis.

#### Key Insights:

* Average Income per Purchase:
  For males who purchased a bike, the average income is $60,000, compared to $56,000 for those who did not. Females who bought a bike had an average income of $55,000, while     those who did not stood at $53,000. Notably, individuals who did not purchase a bike generally earned less than those who made a purchase.

* Commute Distance:
Individuals residing closer to work (0-1 miles) are more inclined to purchase bikes. Fewer bike purchases are observed for those living farther from work, especially beyond 10 miles.

* Gender:
Males demonstrate a higher propensity to purchase bikes compared to females.

* Customer Age Brackets:
The middle age group (31 to 54) exhibits a higher likelihood of purchasing bikes compared to older individuals (55+) and adolescents (31 and below). This trend may suggest a preference for biking as an exercise option among the middle-aged demographic.

* Marital Status:
Married individuals show a greater inclination to purchase bikes compared to their single counterparts.

#### Recommendations

Understanding these key insights can significantly inform marketing and sales strategies for bike sellers in Europe. Targeted marketing campaigns aimed at middle-aged, married individuals residing closer to work may yield higher success rates. Additionally, considering income variations among gender groups can help tailor pricing and promotional strategies to effectively reach different segments of potential buyers. The dataset provides a valuable foundation for data-driven decision-making, enabling bike sellers to optimize their approaches and enhance overall sales performance.
